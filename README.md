# 🚀 InstantScrape (ASP.NET Core MVC)

InstantScrape is a **.NET Core MVC** application designed to scrape real-time data from the web based on two user inputs:

- **Category** (e.g., "Hotels", "Electricians", "Restaurants")
- **Place** (e.g., "London", "Mumbai", "New York")

Using **Selenium WebDriver**, the application fetches and displays the **top 20 recent search results** in a beautifully formatted UI.
